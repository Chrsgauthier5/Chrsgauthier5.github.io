    <h1>Chris's Favorite Animal</h1>
    <h2>It has 4 legs</h2>
    <h3>It also has fur</h3>
    <h4>It is a mammal</h4>
    <h5>It has paws</h5>
    <h6>It is a DOG!!!</h6>
    
    <p>Why is a dog my favorite animal you ask?  They are always happy to see you.
        <br><br>
        They wag their tails when they are happy.  They lick you and cheer you up when you are feeling down.
        <br><br>
        Dogs are big goof balls and they are awesome.
